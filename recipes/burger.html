  burgers

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
  <br />
  <li>1 small onion, grated</li>
  <br />
  <li>2 cloves crushed garlic</li>
  <br />
  <li>1 small zucchini, shredded</li>
  <br />
  <li>1 ½ cups rolled oats</li>
  <br />
  <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
  <br />
  <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
  <br />
  <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <br />
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Heat the olive oil in a skillet over low heat, and cook the onion and garlic
    for about 5 minutes, until tender. Mix in the carrots, squash, and zucchini.
    Continue to cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat, and mix in
    oats, cheese, and egg. Stir in soy sauce, transfer the mixture to a bowl,
    and refrigerate 1 hour.

    Place the flour on a large plate. Form the vegetable mixture into eight 3
    inch round patties. Drop each patty into the flour, lightly coating both
    sides.

    Oil the grill grate, and grill patties 5 minutes on each side, or until
    heated through and nicely browned.
